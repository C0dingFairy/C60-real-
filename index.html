        <p id="aboutbaking">Have you ever baked or cooked before? It's fun right? If you haven't baked before then you're in for a treat! Get it? <em>treat?</em> Oh well, let's get started. I have baked many things, such as cakes. I've done chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. I have baked cupcakes with the flavors of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and devil's food cake. I have also made chocolate chip cookies and crossiants. I can make ice cream and have made vanilla cakes from scratch. I also mix the cakes such as vanilla and strawberry. I also make a lot of banana bread. I really want to make red velvet, mango cake, and rose cake one day. I have cooked omelet, paneer chili, and scrambled eggs. I have also made dal rice. Check out the dessert I really want to make: <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/red_velvet_cupcakes_with_cream_cheese_frosting/" target="_blank">Red Velvet Cupcakes</a>!</p>

        <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
        <p>What's my inspiration to cook? I just have fun when I am creating food, also I love to eat good food! From cakes to curries, I want to learn to cook them and when I'm done, I'll eat them! I also love to watch cooking and baking shows, I want to be able to bake like them!For example, MasterChef India makes cool things and gives lots of tips and tricks for cooking and baking. Nailed It! also gives some tips and tells you how to make the challenges, the contestants do not do so good, but I learn from their mistakes.</p>
